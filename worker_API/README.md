# P2PoW API
Worker API for P2PoW (delegated Proof of Work), Nano cryptocurrency

## Current Version
2.0.0

## Configuring your Worker API
#### Edit config/worker_config.json

Here we have the main information to be followed by the P2PoW API.
Some variables can be edited as needed.

- **reward_account**: Your Nano Account where the rewards will be deposited. It must have a small amount of Nano as it will be used to register your network node within a transaction. 0.00000001 Nano is enough

- **private_key**: The secret of the reward account (attention, do not confuse with the seed). Required to sign the decentralized registration transaction. Don't worry, the registration transaction signature is made directly from your computer and no one else will have access to your private keys.

- **representative**: Your preferred Nano Representative Account

- **fee**: The Minimum Fee you prefer for each work, represented in mNano. Current suggestion: 0.0001 <br> *From node V21.2, receiving transactions require less proof of work, so the API will charge a little less to validate this type of block, but based on your configured fee.

- **node**: Your Nano node address with RPC port. Probably <strong>[::1]:7076</strong> or <strong>127.0.0.1:7076</strong>

- **worker**: Your Worker Node Address (can be the same as node). To offer your worker on the network it is recommended <a href="https://github.com/anarkrypto/P2PoW/tree/master/worker_API#gpu">to use GPU</a>

- **listen**: Host address for API listen. 0.0.0.0 to listen external IP addresses. Also, remember to open the firewall ports.

- **port**: API running Port. The default port of the P2PoW API is 7090, not change it if you want your worker to be found by users

Advanced use (It is not recommended to edit):

- **use_dynamic_pow**: If set to true, the API will maintain the network's active difficulty, but can be ignored for now, I recommend you leaving false

- **dynamic_pow_interval**: How often to check the active difficulty. 

_ **use_dynamic_fee**: If use_dynamic_pow is activated, it is possible to have a dynamic fee as well, based on the multiplier of the active difficulty. This functionality could be better explored in the future or for isolated cases. For now, the recommendation is to leave it disabled due to the fact that it would require a constant and accurate synchronization of the client with his worker.

- **max_multiplier**: Max Multiplier will be the maximum PoW difficulty your worker will accept when using active difficulty in dynamic PoW

- **show_network_difficulty**: Returns active_difficulty when the user requests the endpoint /request_info

worker_config.json example:
```
    {
    	"reward_account": "nano_3k8it4efod5hw194axu1m483qee7pryfrfung9pyr8x9pysfpz1bothqmo1y",
	"private_key": "79E937E6A24B2ABC7DD3894F03BF62303BE8CBA936CBEC7CA3BACEC763AF3BB2",
	"representative": "nano_3x7cjioqahgs5ppheys6prpqtb4rdknked83chf97bot1unrbdkaux37t31b",
 	"fee": 0.0001,
	"node": "[::1]:7076",
	"worker": "[::1]:7076",
 	"max_multiplier": 30.0,
 	"use_dynamic_pow": false,
 	"use_dynamic_fee": false,
 	"dynamic_pow_interval": 30,
 	"show_network_difficulty": true,
 	"listen": "0.0.0.0",
 	"port": 7090
    }
```


## How to run

First you will need to have a <strong>Nano node >= V21.2</strong> installed and synchronized.
<a href="https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/node-setup/" target="_blank">Running a Nano node</a>

Install dependencies (Linux debian/ubuntu based systems):

```bash
    sudo apt intall git python3 python3-pip
```

Clone this repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anarkrypto/p2pow.git
```

Go to workerAPI directory:
```bash
  cd p2pow/worker_API
```

Install python dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt			
```
run:
```
python3 api.py
```
When starting you will have the following type of output:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anarkrypto/P2PoW/master/docs/screenshots/p2pow_v2.0.0_starting.png">


## How it works

The user requests Workers info at the endpoint **worker_ip_address:7090/request_info**

Example (GET):
```curl http://157.245.80.20:7090/request_info```

And get the following kind of response:
```
     {				 
	"version": "2.0.0",
	"status": "available",
	"reward_account": "nano_3k8it4efod5hw194axu1m483qee7pryfrfung9pyr8x9pysfpz1bothqmo1y",
	"fee": "100000000000000000000000000",
	"fee_receive": "51562500000000000000000000",
	"dynamic_fee": false,
	"last_update": 1607674182067,
	"min_multiplier": 1.0,
	"max_multiplier": 30.0,
	"network": {
			"minimum": "fffffff800000000",
			"minimum_receive_minimum": "fffffe0000000000",
			"current": "fffffff800000000",
			"receive_current": "fffffe0000000000",
			"multiplier": "1"
		}
     }
```

Then users will use this information to sign the worker reward block.

- version: The API version, this prevents compatibility issues
- status: While 'available', the user can request proof of work.
- reward_account: where the user will send the workerâ€™s reward
- fee: Minimum fee that the worker requires to validate 'send' and 'change' type blocks
- fee_receive: Minimum fee to validate 'receive' type blocks

Advanced use (dyanmic PoW): 
- min_multiplier: For workers API with dynamic_pow active, indicates the minimum active multiplier of the network.
- max_multplier: The maximum multiplier on the difficulty that the worker makes available. When the active difficulty multiplier exceeds this value, the worker will also change the status to "unavailable".
- dynamic_fee: If not false, it will be an interval in seconds of how many times the fee and fee_receive should be checked and updated. 
- network: An array containing the network's active difficulty info, obtained by the worker node (rpc :: {"action": "active_difficulty"})

Then, users can request the PoW by calling the endpoint **/request_work** sending a json data like the following one:

```
        curl -s --request POST --data '{
          "user_block": 
	  	{
          		"block_type": "state",

          		"link_as_account": "nano_3x8sp3tn1hdm6pnz1xtuhzz4x8utw76mfcno8g6bb9iqc9gskr191tq8eaat",
          		"signature": "69CAEA32BC8E9CF8E47CF4453493929C6BDC11373FD4C228FDBE11A5D76F32A4FF5CFC5D7AD33A67CF3AE9014434B39CDFE83BB9F5F2BF08F5ED0EFBC391870D"
          	},
        "reward_block": 
		{
          		"block_type": "state",
          		"account": "nano_1bca3mirn8aauzy5m5o984bfphsxsbwsixc47d535rkg75nbzd3w737n6iya",
          		"previous": "1BD2525DE8E4E439A50322A04C77031D3D0F747C53839F20DB3716DEFC6E2D4D",

          		"link": "BABB6F016CA3B94DDFB978335610516FE6940B392524C5B76E81C62A73014294",
          		"link_as_account": "nano_3goufw1psaxsbqhuky3mcra74uz8ki7mkbb6rpupx1g87bsi4innftt4sckk",
          		"signature": "E40DD1FAB27161FF2DD73FAB20082A04F86632ECFC8FC60707D2B8221B1CFE7C3B01A8D718AC04C3F6F5EC764C8EBD9905CC756FE2DB381D81A0AC7D2A974D00"
          	}
      }' http://157.245.80.20:7090/request_work
```


The first block (user_block) is the user transaction. The second one (reward_block) is responsible for the payment of the worker.

If you are not already familiar with this mechanism, <a href="https://medium.com/@anarkrypto/delegated-proof-of-work-d566870924d9" target="_blank">read my article</a>


If all goes well, the output by the worker API will look like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anarkrypto/P2PoW/master/docs/screenshots/p2pow_v2.0.0_request_work.png" />


If the request is successful, the client will receive a JSON like this:
```
    {
	"successful": {
		"user_block": {
			"hash": "CF49649CC122A8F746FA5C3D387CF369B6108ECDEB5A1E7CBBC4FA89458C8558",
			"work": "617fbbd063c9ac40"
		},
		"reward_block": {
			"hash": "1DA6A5E87D90F2F7CA24443410EE6F58B6834A0F53D1DD147716EE9E6F5AB9A5",
			"work": "fa65a4f7df46174f"
		}
	}
    }
```
Meaning that transactions have already been validated and transmitted over the Nano network.

The reward_block hash is the new previous block of the user's account


### Install as a service using systemd on Linux
#### Automatically booting P2PoW API with the system

1. Create a file /etc/systemd/system/p2pow.service: ``` sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/p2pow.service ```
2. Paste this:
```
    [Unit]
    Description=P2PoW Worker API
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=forking
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/p2pow/worker_API/api.py --output /var/log/p2pow.log
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=15 #wait 15sec before restart
    #User=nobody
    #Group=nogroup
    WorkingDirectory=/home/P2PoW/worker_API
    Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**change /home/p2pow/ to your actual location of P2PoW**
and save (ctrl + s)

3. Make the file executable: ```sudo chmod +x /home/p2pow/worker_API/api.py```
4. Make systemd aware: ```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
5. Test the service: ```sudo systemctl start p2pow```
6. Check status: ```sudo systemctl status p2pow```
7. Start service on boot: ```sudo systemctl enable p2pow.service```
8. Follow logs in realtime: ```sudo journalctl --follow -u p2pow```


## Decentralized Registration
Instead of a Nano-like peering system or protocols like torrent, this project introduced a new way for peers to exchange their IP addresses.
This API automatically saves the worker IP (ipv4 or ipv6) in a Nano transaction, after encoding to nano account format, and associates it with the default register account (1de1egated1proof1ofwork1themain1registration1accountp46rpyr6) as the destination.
That's why you need to put your account private key in worker_config.json and have a small balance there.


P2PoW client read the transaction history of the registration account. There they find the workers account. And in the workers account they will find their IP addresses, through which user<->worker P2P connections are made. The interesting thing about this system is that besides saving bandwidth and avoiding certain attacks, it avoids the need for main peers and also allows us to associate and recognize worker accounts.


## GPU
Although you can use your CPU for testing, if you want to be a worker it is recommended to use a good GPU, as in worker competition the best hardware solves PoW first.
For this you will need to have your GPU drivers properly installed and OpenCL configured. With this your node will use its GPU for PoWs.
